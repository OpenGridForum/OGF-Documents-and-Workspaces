# OGF Document Templates and Tools

To aid the community in preparing documents with elements that have proven to be useful over time and that are consitent with the Open Grid Forum Document Process and Requirements described in GFD.152, the following templates are provided:

* An online [OGF GitBook Document Template](https://docs.ogf.org/ogf-document-template/) at [https://docs.ogf.org/ogf-document-template/](https://docs.ogf.org/ogf-document-template/) 
* A LaTeX package that contains all necessary elements
* A Microsoft Word template that can be used either directly or imported into other similar tools such as OpenOffice or Google Docs.

Use of OGF GitBook spaces is **recommend for convenience but not required** It is intended as a supplement to assist with document preparation workflow. The final submission of documents for publication in completed form on the OGF web site can also be accomplished with other tools such as those listed above. 

OGF GitBook workspaces can also be set up to be synchronized bidirectionally with corresponding repositories the Open Grid Forum organizational pages on GitHub for convenience in addressing document preparation, editing, and discussion steps through GitHub tools such as issues, branching and merging, and pull requests. \(Note GitBook also has its own branching and merge management features, but some communities may be more familiar with or prefer GitHub features for managing and discussing incremental changes.\)
