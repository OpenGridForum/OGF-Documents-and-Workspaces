# OGF Document Types

Four document types are defined at present:

1. **Informational**: To inform the community about a useful idea or set of ideas.
2. **Experimental**: To inform the community about a useful experiment, testbed, or implementation of an idea or set of ideas.
3. **Community Practice:** To inform the community of common practice or process, with the objective to influence the community.
4. **Recommendations**: To document a specification, analogous to an Internet Standards track document. OGF Recommendations are initially designated as "proposed," and following further experience and review may become full OGF recommendations.
