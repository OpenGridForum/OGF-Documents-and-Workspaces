# About OGF Documents

One of the primary purposes of the Open Grid Forum \(OGF\) is to publish documents. These documents provide information and specifications to developers and others involved with use and support of any form of advanced distributed computing, including cloud and grid computing and associated management, infrastructure, data, architecture, application design, deployment, security, automation and control topics and issues.

Documents are most often authored by members of OGF Working Groups, Community Groups or Research Groups \(WGs, CGs or RGs\), but may be submitted by any person. Upon submission, there is a multi-stage review for OGF documents, including editorial review and public comment. For Recommendation track documents, "proposed" recommendations are the basis for reference implementations and may, with sufficient experience, become full OGF recommendations.

Documents in discussion within OGF Working Groups and Research Groups, which are intended to be submitted for publication as part of the OGF Document Series, are called Grid Working Drafts \(GWD's\). Once approved by the OGF Editor and the Grid Forum Steering Group \(GFSG\), a final document \(GFD\) becomes part of the OGF Document Series.
