# OGF Documents and Work Spaces

## Purpose

Open Grid Forum documents are prepared according to an open public process. The purpose of these GitBook spaces is to encourage collaborative development of community-based documents for submission through this process as decribed below. Use of GitBook is **not required**, but is intended as a supplement to assist with document preparation workflow.

For additional details on OGF document style including example formatting guidelines, refer to the [OGF Document Templates section](ogf-document-templates.md) of this document.

Further information including a full description of the document process and advice intended to help to guide selection from among these categories is contained in GFD.152 \(Open Grid Forum Document Process and Requirements\) available at: [https://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.152.pdf](https://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.152.pdf)
